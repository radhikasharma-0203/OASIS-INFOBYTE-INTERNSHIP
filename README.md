# OASIS-INFOBYTE-INTERNSHIP
During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I was assigned five exciting and diverse tasks to work on

Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
The classification of iris flowers into three distinct species setosa, versicolor, and virginica based on their measurements is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and pattern recognition. The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine-learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species using their measurement attributes.

Task 2: Unemployment Analysis With Python
Analyzing unemployment trends is crucial for policymakers and economists to understand the dynamics of the job market. Using Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries, I created interactive charts and insightful graphs to reveal unemployment trends over time and across regions.This analysis provided valuable insights into economic cycles and helped identify potential areas of intervention to address unemployment challenges effectively.

Task 3: Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Accurate car price prediction is essential for both buyers and sellers. In this project, I developed a machine learning model to estimate the price of used cars based on various features. After collecting a comprehensive dataset containing car attributes and prices, I focused on data preprocessing and feature engineering. I experimented with various regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest Regressor to create a robust and precise model. This empowered car buyers to make informed decisions and enabled sellers to set fair prices, revolutionizing the automotive industry.

Task 4: Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning
Email spam is a pervasive issue affecting millions of users daily. To combat this problem, I developed a machine learning model to accurately classify emails as either spam or legitimate. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and feature engineering on a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails, I prepared the text data for modeling.

Task 5: Sales Prediction Using Python 
Sales prediction is a crucial task for businesses to make informed decisions about resource allocation, marketing strategies, and inventory management. Machine learning techniques provide a powerful way to forecast future sales based on various influencing factors. The leveraging the power of Python's machine learning libraries, businesses can develop accurate sales prediction models that contribute to their growth and success.
